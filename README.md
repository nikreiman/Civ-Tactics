Civ-Tactics
===========

These maps are for practicing battlefield tactics in [Civ V][1]. Each map is a 1-on-1 scenario with almost everything disabled except military victory, freeing you from the usual hassle of running an empire to concentrate on winning battles. The maps include:

* Beach Assault: launch an amphibious invasion on a coastal city with limited naval support.
* Bridge: a narrow land bridge separates you from the enemy capital, forcing you to move units efficiently through the bottleneck.
* Desert: a completely open and flat map good for practicing movement and formations.
* Forest: a densely forested map where you must use workers to shape the terrain to your advantage.
* Gentle Hills: a mostly flat map with a few hills and forests to use for cover.
* Hills: each capital city is surrounded by hills, making it harder to approach.
* Sea Battle: an ocean map for practicing naval tactics.

In each scenario, the enemy nation has approximately 50% more units than you. Since the game AI is rather bad at moving units in formation, this is necessary to keep the fight "fair" (otherwise the scenarios are quite easy, even on deity). However, both players are limited to one city, thus removing the AI's key advantage at higher difficulties -- increased production. Thus, the maps are a good way to familiarize oneself with the AI's battle tactics at the highest difficulty levels, and as such the default difficulty is set to "deity".

France has been selected as the nation in each scenario for both sides, since it doesn't receive any particular battle advantages from its leader attributes.


Installation
------------

The maps can be installed from Steam by searching for "civstrategy.net" and downloading the mod pack. Likewise, the maps can be installed manually by downloading a [zipfile archive][2] and decompressing the data to your `Maps` directory. The location of this folder varies depending on how Civ V was installed on your machine, so it's best to Google for it.
